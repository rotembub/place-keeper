<!-- Here we will show a map and allow users to manage their places.
Tips: 
• Use the 'create Google Api' doc to create an API key and secure it. 
• This ex involves self learning and handling new documentation that we 
haven’t met yet.
• Self learning new technologies is a big part of being a pro programmer! 
Steps
• Show a map centered at Eilat, when user clicks the button 
(search for "my location png" in google), get his current location 
and center the map accordingly.
o Something like:
map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng( 45, 19 ) 
• When a user clicks on the map, the user is prompted to enter a 
name and the clicked location is saved to a places array in the 
localStorage.
o BONUS: use inputs
• Show the list and allow the user to remove a place.
• Use a place-service that manages the place entity, a place object
looks like that:
{id: 123, lat: 32.1416, lng: 34.831213, name: 'Pukis house'}
• Add navigation links to all pages.
• Bonus: Create more pages and try out some HTML5 features we 
have covered -->
